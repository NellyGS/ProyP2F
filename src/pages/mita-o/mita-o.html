    <p>A few days ago I heard the song "Perfect" on the radio and I liked it so much that I told myself I would get the album when it came out. Having finally listened to it, all I can say is that I was definitely not expecting such a solid and cohesive album from a group that is meant to cater mostly to teens.

        There are many gems on this album such as Long Way Down, Olivia, Hey Angel, Never Enough, or What a Feeling, just to name a few, that will leave you feeling nostalgic, blissful and hopeful that this won't be the last we hear from the band.
        
        The songs are beautifully arranged and diverse in terms of sounds and styles, taking influences from various musical eras and artists. Overall, I would say this is a satisfying album; one that sounds quite mature and teases with the possibilities of what a more adult One Direction could bring to the table if they were to come back from their hiatus in the future.</p>

      <p>Dear critics who said One Direction would fall apart when Zayn left....BAM! Say hello to Made in the A.M. I love this album! I love that it's like the Beatles meets Fleetwood Mac meets Paul Simon all shaking hands with One Direction's style. It's fun to listen to. Just when I think I've chosen a favorite song, the next song comes on and I change my mind. There aren't any songs I skip because they are all great! What a way for these boys to go out on hiatus! Congratulations to One Direction for showing the world a "boyband" created on tv has serious talent, staying power and the ability to write, produce and release a fantastic album!! I can't wait to see what these guys do after taking a well deserved break. This isn't the last we'll see of 1D and I'm excited for what's next!</p>

        <p>So amazing, this is the sound that I have been waiting for. They have really matured over the last 5 years. If you loved them before you will love them more now, and if you didn't before you need to try them again!!!</p>
