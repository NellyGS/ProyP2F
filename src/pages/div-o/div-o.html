          <p>Amazing! I love love love Ed and his music! I have been a fan for many years! I pre ordered this CD and was ecstatic to have it delivered on the release date. I might burn out this CD from playing so much, there isn't a song that I skip! I am so happy that I ordered the deluxe version!

                Update: I am and big dummy and just realized this is a 45 and not a 33.3. Raised to 4 stars.

                The voice is off in the record. It is very deep and does not sound like Ed Sheeran. Background music is fine. Double checked other records and this is the only one with the issue. This is a new issue for me, I have never had just one issue with vocals and music is fine. Usually it is the entire album quality is low.

                  It's not always easy to follow up an album with such HUGE success as Ed's "X" was. So I must say I was pleasantly surprised to receive and listen to my copy of "Divide" and realize just how strong of an album it is. In my opinion I believe it is his best album yet - and that's saying A LOT! The one thing I love about Divide is Ed manages to provide EVERY type of music he makes into his albums - be it pop, rap, up-tempo, very slow ballad, Irish folk, etc. His "sound" is so many different sounds.
                  Eraser and Shape of you everyone has already heard by now I'm sure. But there are so many other great gems you will have the pleasure of experiencing....one of my favorites is Dive, a slower melodic song with a great guitar rhythm and strong vocals. But maybe I'm just a sucker for heart tugging songs, because Supermarket Flowers, a song about his Mum(grandmother) will possibly bring tears to your eyes. It is a great example of an album with a lot of maturity and continues Ed's willingness to open his heart and soul to his fans.
                  But don't fear, there are plenty upbeat and humorous additions including some Irish influenced tunes like Nancy Mulligan and Galway girl (starts Irish, flows to rap, back to Irish , etc - like only Ed could do).
                  If you like Ed you will love this album. Period. If your new to Ed this is probably the best album to introduce you to a songwriting/singing genius.
